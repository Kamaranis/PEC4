# Exploratory Data Analysis of TV Series Trends

## ðŸ“„ Project Goal

This project delves into the world of television series through the lens of data. Using a dataset compiled from various sources [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vandalos/movies-and-tv-shows-from-tmdb), this analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in what makes a TV show successful and popular.  

The dataset is a snapshot retrieved from The Movie Database (TMDb) API, containing metadata for up to 50 movies and 50 TV shows per genre specifically available on Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney+ and/or Prime Video. After collecting the content by genre and platform, duplicates were removed, resulting in a total of 1,930 unique entries.

The core objective is to answer questions like:
*   Which streaming platforms host the highest-rated content?
*   What are the most dominant genres in the TV landscape?
*   How have TV show characteristics (like runtime or number of seasons) evolved over the years?
*   Is there a correlation between the year of release and viewer ratings?

## âœ¨ Analysis Highlights & Key Questions Answered

This project is a deep dive into the features that define modern television, showcased through a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook.

*   **Platform Wars:** A comparative analysis of IMDb ratings across major streaming services like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, and HBO Max to see who comes out on top for quality content.
*   **Genre Popularity:** Identification of the most prevalent genres and genre combinations. The analysis also explores which genres tend to receive the highest ratings from viewers.
*   **Temporal Trends:** Visualization of how the number of new shows released per year has changed, highlighting the recent explosion of content.
*   **Rating Distribution:** A statistical look at the distribution of IMDb ratings to understand the baseline for a "good" or "great" show.
